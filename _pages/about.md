## About Me

> Education update : Graduated from Montclair State Universtiy, Major : Computer Science

I love to develop applications using AI 🤖 & Software Engineering 💻 which contribute to real world problems. 
Some of my popular projects: [Autonomous Golf cart](/portfolio/portfolio-1/), [Low resolution Pedestrian image detection](/portfolio/portfolio-2)
and some LLM projects (under work 🏗️).

I am good at `Java`, `SQL`, `python`. I developed various backend API's using `Spring  Framwork `, `Spring Boot/MVC/Security/Data`.

I developed applications with `Object-Oriented Paradigm`,`Domin-Driven Paradigm`, `Event-Driven Paradigm` for `microservices\monolith`.

some of the relational, non-relational databased I was familiar with  `Cassandra`, `PostgresSql`, `MySQL` and `MangoDB`.

For web Applications I use `JavaScript`, `ReactJS`, `NodeJS` and `Next.js`.
