In real time, people are using CCTV for monitoring activities continuously 
but sometimes theft is taking place. In this scenario, people need to roll back the video and 
need to identify when it happened. But in practice, it is a difficult and time-consuming process to identify 
a missing object in the video within the local machine because of the lack of computing resources. 
To solve this problem, we are presenting an algorithm in this paper to notify missing objects in a video 
offloaded from a mobile or CCTV using YOLO3 object detection in a cloudlet network. In the area of cloud computing, a cloudlet is a data center in the local network with a rich set of computing resources available for mobile users.
